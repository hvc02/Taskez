## Tech

Taskez uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJs] - A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Saas] - Pre-preprocessor for CSS
- [React Beautiful DND] - Beautiful and accessible drag and drop for lists with React.
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework

And of course Taskez itself is open source with a [public repository][hvc]
on GitHub.

## Installation
